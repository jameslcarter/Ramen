# Transitions

Transitions are used to transition a css property value to another smoothly let's say on hover or focus, it is normally a time consuming an repetitive to keep writing the transition values for every component that you want to transition. We provide a set of pre-defined transition values that all have the same easing and timing they just adjust what kind of css properties are transitionable. The current timing for a transition is `150ms` and the easing is `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

## Included

- `all` => transitions all css properties of the element.
- `colors` => transitions all color css properties of the element, color css properties include `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, `text-decoration-color`, `fill` and `stroke`.
- `default` => transitions all color css properties but also includes commonly transitioned properties like `opacity`, `box-shadow`, `transform`, `filter` and `backdrop-filter`.
- `opacity` => only transitions the opacity css property.
- `shadow` => only transitions the box-shadow css property.
- `transform` => only transitions the transform css property.

## Usage

export const code1 = `import { styled } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '$full',
  height: '$20',
  backgroundColor: '$pink10',
  borderRadius: '$2xl',
  display: 'grid',
  placeItems: 'center',
  fontWeight: '$bold',
  letterSpacing: '$wide',
  textAlign: 'center',\n\n
  // implementing the default transition
  transition: '$default',\n
  '&:hover': {
    // transitioning the scale on hover
    transform: 'scale(1.1)',
  },
});`;
