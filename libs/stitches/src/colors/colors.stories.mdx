# Colors

One of the most important foundational elements of a design system is having a consistent, accessible, good looking color palette that is used in all components to color them. The noodle stitches library includes a set of colors from the `@radix-ui/colors` package to provide all components this palette.

## Usage

Using any color is really easy with stitches css, you can just assign a property like background-color, color...etc to a string value that starts with a `$` and then the color name.

export const code1 = `import { styled } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Box = styled('div', {
  backgroundColor: '$indigo10',
  color: '$gray1',
});`;

<Source code={code1} dark />
