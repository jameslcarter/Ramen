# Breakpoints

Breakpoints help change the styles of elements based on the screen size, with noodle we have taken a mobile first approach in that all the breakpoints are `min-width`. We currently contain 5 breakpoints `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` and `2xl`.

## Usage

In the example below, the Box component will start off as blue whenever the screen is smaller than the smallest breakpoint mentioned, in this case that is `md`, so the Box will be blue until 768px and then after that it will change to pink, from 768px until the next breakpoint (xl) which is 1280px, the box is pink and anything bigger than that it will be amber.

export const code1 = `import { styled } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Box = styled('div', {
  backgroundColor: '$blue10',\n
  // if screen is bigger than the md breakpoint (768px), background color will be pink
  '@md': {
    backgroundColor: '$pink10'
  },\n
  // if screen is bigger than xl breakpoint (1280px), background color will be amber
  '@xl': {
    backgroundColor: '$amber10',
  },
});`;

<Source code={code1} dark />
