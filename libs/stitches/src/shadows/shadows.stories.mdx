# Shadows

Box shadows are frequently a long value with x, y values, spread...etc so it's beneficial to have a set of pre-defined shadows that can be used quickly and easily. We include 8 different values for shadows that you can use in any component. The shadows included are `sm`, `base`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `inner` and `none`.

## Usage

export const code1 = `import { styled }  from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '$20',
  height: '$20',
  boxShadow: '$2xl',
});`;

<Source code={code1} dark />

<Shadows />
