# Spacings

Having a pre-defined set of space values to be used for stuff like margins, paddings...etc are beneficial in that they will all be consistent throughout the application thus the design will itself be consistent and if any design changes happen to the foundation only a change is required in one place to be reflected all throughout the application. We have many space values that are based on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) space constraints.

## Usage

export const code1 = `import { styled } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Box = styled('div', {
  margin: '$12',
  padding: '$6',
});\n
export const App = () => (
  <Box />
)`;

<Source code={code1} dark />

## Available values

<Spacings entries={Object.entries(space)} />
