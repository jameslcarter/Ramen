The Noodle Stitches theme is a library with the aim of providing a good foundation for all of the user interface components to be built. The library is a [Stitches CSS](https://stitches.dev) configuration that provides certain design guidelines like colors, fonts, sizes...etc so that design of all components stay consistent. The configuration is based on the [Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/).

## Installation

You can install the package into your own project using any of the package managers, if you are contributing to the main Noodle workspace, it is already available to import since it is an NX workspace.

Npm:

<Source code="npm install @noodle/stitches" dark />

Yarn:

<Source code="yarn add @noodle/stitches" dark />

Pnpm:

<Source code="pnpm install @noodle/stitches" dark />

## Usage

You firstly need to wrap your application with the provided `StitchesProvider` component, this applies the css reset and it also enables dark/light mode functionality.

export const code1 = `import { StitchesProvider } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
export const App = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <StitchesProvider>
      {children}
    </StitchesProvider>
  )
};`;

<Source code={code1} dark />

You can then style any of your components using Stitches' styled api:

export const code2 = `import { styled } from '@noodle/stitches';\n
const Button = styled('button', {
  color: '$pink10',
  fontSize: '$lg',
  fontWeight: '$bold',
  border: '1px solid $pink10',
});\n
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Button>Your Button</Button>
  )
}`;

<Source code={code2} dark />

## Guidelines

- No inline styles, refer to variants for conditional styling.
- Use the theme values provided for colors, fonts, sizes...etc to style your components.
- Use the shorthand css properties already available.
- Do not use the css api to make styling for the components.
