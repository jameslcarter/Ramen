The Noodle Stitches theme is a library with the aim of providing a good foundation for all of the user interface components to be built. The library is a [Stitches CSS](https://stitches.dev) configuration that provides certain design guidelines like colors, fonts, sizes...etc so that design of all components stay consistent. The configuration is based on the [Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/).
