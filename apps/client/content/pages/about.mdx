# Noodle

Noodle is a project that aims to solve one of my personal biggest frustrations with education and that's how incapable the tools provided are to make us the most efficient at studying and organizing our lives as students a lot better. Often you are given a platform to access lecture notes, announcements and other bits and pieces of your studies but you're not given a platform to use that content.

You probably use a ton of tools and apps for different aspects of your educational journey, a note taking app, todo list app, probably also a calendar and you need to manage all these apps and websites individually and somehow make them all synced up with each other.

## Features

As a base, noodle will let you create modules and assign different types of content to them, these include:

- üìù Notes
- ‚è≥ Assignments
- ‚úÖ Todos
- üìÜ Calendar events

## Advantages

When all your different content is on the same platform, you could do pretty awesome things to automatically organize and use that content, such as:

- Create a new note when a lecture started.
- Calculate your current progression percentage of a module from assignment scores.
- Alerts about lectures, todos, assignment dates...etc
- Sync a notebook with a specific lecture PDF.
- Complete todos based on actions such as marking yourself attending for a lecture.

## A bit more

I currently use Craft for note taking, Things 3 for my tasks, Fantastical for the lectures calendar and grade guide to calculate my current progression. It's all a bit much to organize simultaneously and when you have a platform that combines all these aspects then all of your content is automatically synced up, it's easier to manage because it's all there and you get the benefits that these different types of content are all together on one platform and can use each other to give you more insights and tools.

## And the best part, it's all open source!

Noodle is open source by design, you can contribute on it with me, I would be glad to have you on board. You can self host noodle on your own server/machine so that all your data is managed by yourself as well! I want to bring the student community together to develop a better way for us to study, together.
