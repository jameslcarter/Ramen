Noodle is a project that is born out of frustrations with the current solutions available to students.

Often times universities supply students with a platform to access lecture notes, submit assignments and more but using that content is inefficient as that often times you have multiple platforms and apps that you use just to manage all of that. You are most probably using a note taking app, a todo list app, a calendar application as well to manage your life.

What if we combine all of that into one? What if the same place you write your notes also is the same place that you manage your todos, lectures time table...etc? It turns out you can do pretty nice things like:

- Automatically create a notebook when a lecture starts.
- Calculate your current progression in a subject based on the assignment scores.
- Access, manipulate and control your todos as you type your notes and based on actions like when a lecture starts, mark the todo "attend lecture A" as completed.

In theory there are many benefits to combining the features of popular tools and platforms we use into one and letting our imagination go wild when we have access to all of that content in one place. Noodle is a project that aims at exploring just that!
